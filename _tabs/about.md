My name is [Tyler Nichols](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyler-nichols-08148723/).

I graduated with my bachelor's degree from Loyola Marymount University in Computer Science in 2013, spent a year in a PhD program at the University of Oregon studying cryptographic systems, and went on to spend approximately 8 years as an information security engineer at various technology companies in Seattle and the San Francisco Bay Area.

Between 2022 and 2023, I studied artificial intelligence and machine learning via the Stanford Center for Professional Development (SCPD) non-degree option program. I earned my [Graduate Certificate in Artificial Intelligence](https://digitalcredential.stanford.edu/check/C7092F55A5A50E60F137821F3D334DCB163B1003F4FCD244CDE6DBB2CBA1664AZnBFRFBFd2xFODhmODFMYU1rQlJ5dFk2Njkwd1dOcktoeGQ2TVlqaVgrNUN1dWpo) from Stanford University in June 2023 after completing the following courses:

- Fall 2022/2023
  - CS229: [Machine Learning](https://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus-fall2022.html)
- Winter 2022/2023
  - CS224N: [Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1224/)
  - CS224W: [Machine Learning with Graphs](https://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs224w-2023/)
- Spring 2022/2023
  - CS231N: [Deep Learning for Computer Vision](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)
  - CS224U: [Natural Language Understanding](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224u/2022/)

My vision for this blog is to act as an archive of selected works from my time studying artificial intelligence and machine learning at Stanford, as well as some of the extracurricular machine learning projects and research and I have worked on.

In doing so, I hope that I can provide perspectives on complex and, often times, opaque material that others find enlightening while reinforcing my own understanding of the material.
