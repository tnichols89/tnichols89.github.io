My name is [Tyler Nichols](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyler-nichols-08148723/). I am a career cybersecurity professional with a sophisticated expertise in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

I graduated with my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Loyola Marymount University in 2013, spent a year studying cryptographic systems at the University of Oregon, and went on to spend approximately 8 years as an information security engineer at various technology companies in Seattle and the San Francisco Bay Area.

Between 2022 and 2023, I studied artificial intelligence and machine learning at Stanford University through the Stanford Center for Professional Development (SCPD) as part of the non-degree option program. I earned my [Graduate Certificate in Artificial Intelligence](https://digitalcredential.stanford.edu/check/C7092F55A5A50E60F137821F3D334DCB163B1003F4FCD244CDE6DBB2CBA1664AZnBFRFBFd2xFODhmODFMYU1rQlJ5dFk2Njkwd1dOcktoeGQ2TVlqaVgrNUN1dWpo) in June 2023 after completing the following courses:

- Fall 2022/2023
  - CS229: [Machine Learning](https://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus-fall2022.html)
- Winter 2022/2023
  - CS224N: [Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1224/)
  - CS224W: [Machine Learning with Graphs](https://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs224w-2023/)
- Spring 2022/2023
  - CS231N: [Deep Learning for Computer Vision](https://cs231n.stanford.edu/)
  - CS224U: [Natural Language Understanding](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224u/2022/)

I envision this blog as an archive of selected works from my time studying artificial intelligence and machine learning at Stanford, as well as some of the extracurricular machine learning projects and research I have worked on. Where possible, I intend to supplement technical and mathematical content with high level explanations designed to build a deeply intuitive conceptual understanding of the material.

My chief hopes in creating this blog are that it:
1. Reinforces my own understanding of the material as I write everything up
1. Serves as a convenient resource for me to revisit past material and occasionally refresh my understanding of key concepts
1. Provides other students with intuitive and insightful perspectives on complex and often opaque material

I hope you find the resources herein enlightening, and I wish you the best of luck on your academic journey.
